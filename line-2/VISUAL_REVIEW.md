# Pepe 01 visual and output review

- Wall: `artifacts/line-2/wall.png`, PNG, RGB, **1254 × 1254 px**. This exactly matches the input cave's dimensions and square framing.
- Preview: `dist/line-2/01.jpg`, JPEG, RGB, **512 × 512 px**, 76,192 bytes.
- Record: `dist/line-2/01.json`; number 1, Cave Ice, Wall Line 2. Its image URL uses the SHA-256 of the finished PNG bytes.
- PNG SHA-256: `91b60180e3c0eae1151aee315645029dda7504a806897e355b083e1df631cae8`.

## Chosen review step

Visually inspected the cave input and both generated renders. The first render's upper hand appeared to have four digits, so a targeted second edit added its missing thumb. Counted the final upper hand as four upward/rightward fingers plus one downward thumb, and the lower hand as four fingers plus one thumb: five each. There are no hand stencils. The finished figure has Pepe's wide mouth and large heavy-lidded eyes. Four white pebble circles in each row pair up; the bottom row has one additional red pebble.

The final image retains the input's ceiling, floor, major cracks, warm illumination and square framing. The new marks use charcoal, red/yellow ochre and chalk-like white, with stone texture visible through them. No letters, numbers, captions, signatures, logos, watermark, border, political or hateful symbols, or real people were observed. This was the first Pepe on this wall, so no ancestral marks were present to preserve.

Unmet visual requirements: **none observed on review**. Limitation: a generative edit preserves the cave visually, but does not guarantee pixel-identical geology or lighting outside the painted area. Review is a human-style visual assessment, not an automated guarantee of artistic quality. PNG/JPEG headers, dimensions, record shape, digest, and file size were checked separately with code.

## Generation provenance and prompt

Used the built-in `image_gen.imagegen` tool in edit mode, with `artifacts/ice/cave.png` as the initial edit target and the first result as the correction target. The image tool's generated PNG was copied into the declared wall path. A temporary Pillow checker in disposable `test/scratch/` converted the final wall to the required JPEG preview; it is not a dependency of any delivered code.

Initial prompt: preserve the exact square cave framing, warm rock, cracks, torchlight, ceiling, floor and shadows; add only a worn prehistoric pigment drawing of recognizable Pepe squatting beside two rows of four paired white pebbles with one extra red pebble in the bottom row. Give him a wide mouth, heavy-lidded eyes, and two open five-digit hands; use charcoal, red/yellow ochre and chalk white only, with no writing, logos, frames, or modern rendering.

Final correction prompt: keep the entire cave, Pepe, pebbles and lower hand unchanged; correct only the upper hand by adding one short downward thumb to the four existing upward/rightward fingers. Exactly five separated digits, primitive worn red-ochre/charcoal pigment; no other changes or text.

## Pepe 22 output review

- Wall: `artifacts/line-2/wall.png` and required `artifacts/line-2/wall-v2.png`; both are PNG, RGB, **1254 × 1254 px**. Their SHA-256 is `b267e67040355641a9dfa0b41c55d96330ad5e237e5dea8b966345fffc58ae40`.
- Preview: `dist/line-2/22.jpg`, JPEG, RGB, **512 × 512 px**, under 100 KB.
- Record: `dist/line-2/22.json`; number 22, Cave Ice, Wall Line 2. Its image URL contains the SHA-256 of the finished wall.
- Parent wall: the exact PNG bytes linked by Pepe 01's record were restored before compositing. The new transparent motif was resized and overlaid in the upper-right open rock. The previous painting and all pixels outside the new motif remain unchanged.

Visually inspected the final wall and its JPEG preview. The new smaller figure reads as Pepe through its wide mouth and heavy-lidded eyes. Its raised open hand has four separated fingers and one thumb. The rows of ochre/white/dark pebbles include one pebble set aside. The earlier large figure and its pebble rows remain in place. Rock, framing, cracks, warm cave light, and foreground are preserved. No letters, numbers, captions, logos, watermarks, borders, political/hateful symbols, or real people were observed.

Unmet visual requirements: **none observed**. Visual inspection is not an automated guarantee. The added motif is a composited transparent image, so its pigment texture is generated rather than physically painted into the source photograph. PNG/JPEG headers, dimensions, SHA-256, JSON shape, and file sizes were separately checked.

Pepe 22 used the built-in image-generation tool to create a transparent cave-painting motif, then composited it over the exact prior PNG. The resulting wall was resized to a 512 px JPEG preview. CSV Reconcile added a `--format text` mode; all 17 standard-library tests passed, and the README command produced the documented synthetic inventory report with the expected difference exit status 1.

## Pepe 23 — The Shared Tablet

- Final wall: `artifacts/line-2/wall-v3.png` and identical `artifacts/line-2/wall.png`, **1254 × 1254**, RGB PNG. These preserve the parent's square dimensions and framing.
- SHA-256 of either PNG: `e55fc5356154d13beaec1efebeb47665088fda6915f1833c1522ba17d983b88b`.
- Preview: `dist/line-2/23.jpg`, **512 × 512**, JPEG, 73,026 bytes.
- Record: `dist/line-2/23.json`, number 23 (22 prior JSON records), exact requested record shape and matching artifact digest. Older records are unchanged.
- Restored parent hash: `b267e67040355641a9dfa0b41c55d96330ad5e237e5dea8b966345fffc58ae40`, from record 22's public artifact URL. A decoded RGB comparison found **31,903 changed pixels**, all within the new motif's bounding box **x 758–1007, y 806–1034** (zero-based inclusive). Every other pixel is identical to the parent. The two ancestral figures, their hands and pebble rows are untouched.

Chosen review step: viewed the parent, generated motif and final composite with the image viewer. The added small Pepe sits below the earlier pebble rows on previously open rock, with heavy-lidded eyes, a wide ochre mouth and a tablet showing paired pebble rows and an unmatched red pebble. His hands are hidden behind the tablet; there are no new visible hands or handprints to count. The large ancestral figure's two open hands retain four fingers and one thumb each; the upper-right ancestor's raised hand also retains five digits. No letters, numbers, captions, logos, watermarks, frames or forbidden symbols were observed. Cave rock, cracks, light and framing remain unchanged outside the compact addition.

Unmet visual requirements: **none observed**. Limitations: visual review is a local artistic assessment, not certification. The motif is composited pigment artwork; its small tablet and lighter pigment patch may appear more solid than ancestral marks. It occupies open stone without replacing an earlier painting. The new tool and its reports contain words; the wall image does not.

Used the available installed image-generation tool `mcp__image__generate_image` (one call), then existing FFmpeg to crop/scale its transparent motif, composite at x 755, y 805, and create the JPEG. No image-processing package or runtime dependency was installed. The generated motif occupied the final output path temporarily and was replaced with the completed wall; no extra image file is retained.

Generation prompt: “Create an isolated prehistoric cave painting pigment motif on a pure white background for compositing onto an existing warm cave wall. Only the motif, no rock background. A small squat recognizable Pepe the frog cave figure facing right with huge heavy-lidded eyes and a wide horizontal mouth, charcoal outlines, faded yellow and red ochre and charcoal pigment. He holds up a thin ochre flat stone tablet showing two parallel rows of three little charcoal and ochre pebbles, one unmatched red pebble beside the rows: he makes a comparison visible for another worker. Arms end behind the tablet so NO hands or fingers are visible. Feet simple frog shapes. Handmade uneven worn dry brush textures and broken pigment, like Lascaux or Chauvet, not modern smooth cartoon shading. Compact single motif centered with generous completely white margin all around. Absolutely NO text, letters, numbers, symbols resembling writing, caption, watermark, logo, border or frame. No photograph or 3D render. Use earth pigment colours only.” The tool returned a transparent PNG, which allowed preservation of the source rock.

## Pepe 24 — The Joining Trails

- Finished wall: `artifacts/line-2/wall.png` and required `artifacts/line-2/wall-v4.png`, identical RGB PNGs, **1254 × 1254 px**, **3,936,061 bytes** each. SHA-256: `a1211bf5210aaf31a60eeb67ef85ca50a1f51a7e381badf2cfb4548648b34cbc`. The restored parent matched record 23's SHA-256 before compositing.
- Preview: `dist/line-2/24.jpg`, baseline RGB JPEG, **512 × 512 px**, **68,197 bytes**. Record: `dist/line-2/24.json`, number 24, with the PNG digest in its artifact URL. The goal and previous records were not changed.
- The new isolated motif was RGBA PNG, **1774 × 887 px**, with transparent margins. It was reduced to **250 × 125 px** and placed at **x 702, y 142**. An independent decoded-pixel comparison against the SHA-256-verified parent found **9,503 changed pixels**, all inside that rectangle and **zero changed outside it**. This patch is above and clear of all three earlier Pepes and their pebble marks, so ancestral paint remains visible.

Chosen visual review: inspected the full wall and 512 px preview. The new crouching figure has Pepe's heavy-lidded eyes and wide mouth. Three colored pebble trails converge toward one trail, echoing the three-way merge. The motif has no visible hands or handprints; there are no new digits to count. Earlier visible hands retain five digits each. The cave's warm rock, cracks, torchlight and framing remain visible. No writing, letters, numbers, captions, signatures, logos, watermarks, borders, real people, political or hateful signs were observed.

Unmet visual requirements: **none observed**. Limitations: the new figure is small at 512 px preview size; the converging trails are clearer on the full wall. The pigment is a composited generated motif rather than a physical change to the stone. Visual inspection is a judgment, not an automated guarantee. The source wall's parent digest, PNG/JPEG headers, dimensions, record shape, and sizes were checked separately.
