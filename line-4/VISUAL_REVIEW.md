# Visual review: Pepe 01

- Wall file: `artifacts/line-4/wall.png`, PNG, 1254 × 1254 px.
- Record image: `dist/line-4/01.jpg`, JPEG, 512 × 512 px.
- The bare Ice cave's square framing, rock surface, cracks, and warm light remain visible. One rough ochre Pepe with heavy-lidded eyes and a wide mouth holds a tablet with abstract grooves.
- I inspected a close view of both hands: each is painted with four separated finger strokes and an opposing thumb (five digits). No letters or numbers are visible.
- Unmet visual requirements observed: none.

# Visual review: Pepe 22 — The bound message

- Output: `artifacts/line-4/wall-v2.png`, valid PNG, 1254 × 1254 pixels,
  2,514,439 bytes; `wall.png` holds identical finished bytes for the next worker.
- Record 22: `dist/line-4/22.json`; preview `22.jpg`, valid JPEG,
  512 × 512 pixels, 54,089 bytes (FFmpeg conversion).
- Viewed the ancestor painting and the generated finished wall. The square
  framing, warm rough rock, cracks, light and ancestral tablet keeper remain
  visually in place. The added small charcoal/ochre bundle of tied reeds sits
  above the frog, clear of its existing marks. The original heavy-lidded eyes,
  wide mouth, tablet and crouching body remain visible. No new hands were added;
  each ancestral hand has four fingers and one thumb (five digits).
- No letters, numbers, captions, signatures, political symbols, borders or
  watermarks observed. The bundle is a pictorial object, with uneven worn strokes.
- Unmet new visual requirements observed: none. Image generation is not a
  pixel-exact preservation method; continuity was assessed visually, not proved
  by exact pixel identity. The inherited 01.jpg remains over 100 KB; older
  records were preserved as required. New source/record/preview files are below
  100 KB each. Only the finished PNG and required JPEG were saved as new pictures.
- Technical checks: 12 ABI regressions passed; the original demo and alias ABI
  CLI produced `0xa9059cbb`. No network is needed by these tests. GOAL.md is
  unchanged. No RPC call, signing, payment, posting or deployment was performed.

# Visual review: Pepe 23 — The message sieve

- Required output: `artifacts/line-4/wall-v3.png`, valid PNG, 1254 × 1254 px,
  2,509,256 bytes. `artifacts/line-4/wall.png` has identical bytes for continuity.
  SHA-256: `2548971366e8da1ea9d302d5b3494d18b50c36674511bc61e4bb294e38ce06f1`.
- New record: `dist/line-4/23.json`. Preview: `dist/line-4/23.jpg`, valid JPEG,
  512 × 512 px, 75,392 bytes. Both formats/dimensions were checked with the image
  inspection tool. Viewed the generated wall and final JPEG.
- Added one shallow clay sieve in red ochre and charcoal to the empty rock beside
  the existing tablet. It represents filtering malformed inputs before use.
  Warm torchlight, square framing, cracks, keeper, tablet and bound reeds remain
  visually in place. The existing Pepe has heavy-lidded eyes and a wide mouth.
  Each existing hand was inspected for four fingers and one thumb; no new hands
  or handprints were added. No letters, numbers, captions, signatures, logos,
  watermarks, borders or political symbols observed.
- Unmet new visual requirements observed: none. Preservation was assessed
  visually; image generation does not prove pixel-exact preservation of every
  ancestral stroke or rock pixel. The inherited oversized `01.jpg` remains
  unchanged; new source, record and preview files each stay below 100 KB.
- Local technical results: 23 tests pass. Actual malformed-object and missing-file
  CLI calls return exit 2 without tracebacks; demo and alias selector stay
  `0xa9059cbb`. The goal and all older records remain unchanged. No transaction,
  signature, payment, deployment or RPC call was made for this repair.

# Visual review: Pepe 24 — The pebbled sequence

- Required output: `artifacts/line-4/wall-v4.png`, PNG, 1254 × 1254 pixels,
  2,438,792 bytes. `wall.png` contains identical bytes for the next worker.
  SHA-256: `a6261e1b3ba49d0e4749152bc7bc1a097b6aecb11be67cd9fb50faa7da739ad0`.
- New record: `dist/line-4/24.json`; preview: `24.jpg`, baseline JPEG,
  512 × 512 pixels, 54,636 bytes. Both image formats and dimensions were checked,
  and the final JPEG was opened for visual review.
- Four small red-ochre pebbles curve down from the previous sieve on clear rock.
  The warm rock, cracks, torchlight, square framing, crouching Pepe, heavy-lidded
  eyes, wide mouth, five-digit hands, tablet and tied reeds remain visible. No
  new hand or handprint was added. No letters, numbers, captions, signatures,
  logos, watermarks, borders or political symbols were observed.
- Unmet visual requirements observed: none. The image editor may have changed
  rock pixels or ancestral strokes subtly; visual inspection cannot certify
  pixel-exact preservation. The inherited oversized `01.jpg` was not modified.
- The tool's 27 offline tests passed. Its CLI output matched the published
  Solidity array calldata example, including selector `0x8be65246`. GOAL.md
  and all older records are unchanged. No transaction was signed or sent.
